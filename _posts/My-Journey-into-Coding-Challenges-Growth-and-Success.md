## Beginning at BITS Hyderabad

I remember vividly my first day at BITS Hyderabad on July 30, 2019. During our week-long induction, which included various activities and a talent night, I realized I had no noticeable talents. There was also an introductory programming class where I couldn't grasp a single concept in C.

In my first semester, I struggled with courses that required coding, such as Introduction to Programming, barely passing with a 4 CGPA. I understood the concepts but couldn't complete the assignments or labs. The following semester brought Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), and I was failing miserably until COVID-19 shifted everything online, allowing me to pass—barely.

## Diving into Competitive Programming

As the pandemic continued, everyone was intrigued by Leetcode i tried that too. everyone around me was doing great able to solve multiple questions but I was not able to solve many questions always able to solve not more than 2 questions . I remember I consulted senior friends but was not progressing at that time During this time, I took a frontend course on Coursera. Although it was somewhat dull, I enjoyed it and even developed a project called CovidTracker, which I was immensely proud of. It was the first time I felt competent in something.



## My First Internship – A Humbling Beginning

By the time I reached my 4th semester, my CGPA was steadily improving —which felt good on paper but deep down, I knew I wasn't learning anything practical or career-changing. Reality hit hard — I failed miserably in my first internship.

##

In June 2021, as part of my Practice School-I (PS-I), I landed my first internship at Xarvis Labs, earning ₹10,000 per month. I felt like I was on top of the world — especially being the first among my close circle to land an internship. My friends were incredibly supportive, and I was excited to get started. However, things didn’t go as expected. I was new to programming, and the company expected us to brush up on core concepts in just three days and start delivering. My peers quickly picked things up, but I couldn’t even gather the confidence to try. I froze. Eventually, I gave up  and managed somehow to complete that internship. It was a tough moment — I felt lost, disappointed, and unsure about my path forward, especially coming from an electrical engineering background.

But I didn’t stop there. I started learning at my own pace — doing LeetCode problems, revising Data Structures & Algorithms, and mentally preparing myself for a second chance.

## Internship opportunity in 4-1

Fast forward to July 2022, I got another opportunity — an internship at Biz2X through Practice School-II (PS-II). I moved to Noida, which was my first time visiting Northern India, and I was honestly nervous. My first internship experience still haunted me.

But this time, things were different. My previous self-learning in Angular paid off — I was able to grasp concepts quickly and even outperform some peers. That early boost of confidence changed everything. Once I settled in, I picked up Java and Spring Boot, completing the courses at a fast pace.Then came my first real corporate task: building a delete API for an entity in Spring Boot, complete with test cases. Having just learned the concepts, I completed the task efficiently — and it felt amazing. It was a moment of validation that I could thrive in tech.I kept pushing myself, worked consistently, and by the end of the internship, I was thrilled to receive a Pre-Placement Offer (PPO) from Biz2X.

Forever grateful to BITS Pilani — for the opportunities it offered, the lessons it taught, and the memories it gifted. It's magic indeed!

## Starting a Career at  Biz2X

Transitioning from an intern to a full-time Software Developer at Biz2X felt smooth and exciting. I already knew the team, the culture, and the expectations. Having that familiarity made the onboarding process easy, and I could focus fully on growing.

Since then, I’ve had the opportunity to work on both the frontend (Angular) and backend (Java + Spring Boot), contributing to real-world projects and sharpening my full-stack skills. It’s been a fulfilling journey from struggling with self-doubt to building production-ready features.
